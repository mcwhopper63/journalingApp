1.  **Introduction**

    Journal Safe is a unique app designed for those dealing with chronic pain, utilizing the principles of Dr. Sarno's journaling techniques. It provides a private space for users to express themselves freely, ensuring complete confidentiality as each entry is securely destroyed after a preset duration or when the journaling session is over.

2.  **Features**:

    **Privacy**: The app ensures complete privacy by not saving any journal entries, not even in local storage. This means if a user closes the tab or window, their entry gets deleted. This feature supports the idea of fully expressing oneself without the concern of their thoughts being stored or seen by others.

    **Preset Timers**: Users can choose to journal for set periods like five, ten, or twenty minutes. After the selected time, the journal entry automatically disappears. This helps users to stay focused and present in their journaling activity, encouraging them to express their thoughts within the chosen time frame.

3.  **Installation and Setup**:

    Journal Safe is a straightforward web app built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To set it up, simply clone the repository, and open the HTML file in your preferred web browser. No additional installation steps are required, making it accessible for users of all technical backgrounds.

4.  **How to use:**

    1.  Visit the Journal Safe website (journal-safe.netlify.app/)
    2.  Select a preset time for journaling or enter a desired duration.
    3.  Begin journaling in the provided space.
    4.  If you need to stop early, just close the window; your entry won't be saved.
    5.  The app automatically destroys the journal entry when the timer ends, ensuring privacy.

7.  **Developer Comments**:

    I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Sarno, who came up with this technique, Nicole J. Sachs, LCSW, my family, friends, the 100devs community, and chatGPT4.

    Journal Safe was inspired by my personal journey of overcoming the inability to use my left hand and arm in 2020. Committing to journaling has not only helped me physically but also enabled me to learn coding and run a business. I hope Journal Safe brings similar relief and success to your journey.
