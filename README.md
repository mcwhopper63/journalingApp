# Journal Safe

1. Are you stressed? Do you have something on your mind?
2. Write it off! It's very therapeutic!
3. Don't worry, the journal entry will be deleted once you close the app, or once the timer is up. Nothing is saved.

## Installation

This version of the app was created using just HTML, CSS, and JS. Therefore, there is no installation required to use the app. Visit the site and you can use it right away. https://journal-safe.netlify.app/

## Inspiration

I have been suffering from chronic pain in the left arm and left hand. I could not type at all in 2021 and 2022. I read Dr. Sarno's books on healing chronic pain through journaling and created this app. I use this app daily as journaling has become a daily routine in my life.
